# Structify

A visual tool for structuring the buzz in your head. 

This is intended to become a visual tool for establishing some initial structure in
a set of items, when the order and connections between those items are not really
obvious, yet. The desired user experience is one that helps you transition from the
state of plunging in a confusing sea of items (entities, objects, concepts) within
some domain to the state of having a better understanding of these items while you
capture the hidden structure (or model) as it unfolds when you watch these items as
they seem to interact and organize with the help of your thinking in a way that is
visual and tactile at the same time.

More to come...
